        <h1>The Tale of Claws & Paws</h1>
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>In the quiet town of Willowbrook, two unlikely friends - a scrappy alley cat named Claws and a gentle giant dog called Paws - formed a bond that would change their neighborhood forever...</p>
            
            <p>It all began during the Great Storm of 2018 when Claws, then a solitary hunter, found shelter in the same abandoned bookstore as Paws, who had been separated from his family. For three days, they kept each other warm and shared what little food they could find.</p>
            
            <p>When the sun finally returned, they made a pact: Claws would use her street smarts and agility to find food, while Paws would offer protection with his size and loud bark. Together they created a safe haven for other strays, which humans eventually noticed and transformed into the sanctuary we know today.</p>
            
            <p>Their legacy lives on in every animal we help, reminding us that even the most unlikely friendships can create beautiful change.</p>
